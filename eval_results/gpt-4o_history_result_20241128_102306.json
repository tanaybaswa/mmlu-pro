To demonstrate their military prowess to potential allies and enemies (A): This could be a reason, as showing strength can deter enemies and attract allies, but it is more of a strategic reason rather than a less obvious one.\n\n2. To expand their empire's territory (B): This is a very obvious reason for any empire to engage in wars, as territorial expansion is a common goal.\n\n3. To unite their own population through a common enemy (C): This is a less obvious reason. By engaging in wars, the Inca could create a sense of unity and purpose among their people, rallying them against a common foe and strengthening internal cohesion.\n\n4. To identify and cultivate talented leaders (D): While this could be a benefit of engaging in wars, it is not typically a primary reason for initiating conflict.\n\n5. To gain control of vital resources (E): Like territorial expansion, gaining resources is a common and obvious reason for war.\n\nConsidering these options, the less obvious reason for the Inca to fight wars would be to unite their own population through a common enemy, as it focuses on internal social cohesion rather than external gains.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
