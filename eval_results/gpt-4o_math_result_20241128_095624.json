This is a well-known result in ring theory, analogous to the result for group homomorphisms. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\n- This statement lacks context. Without additional information about what \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) are, we cannot determine whether \\( Q \\) is an ideal in \\( R \\). Therefore, Statement 2 is not given.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is not given.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}]
