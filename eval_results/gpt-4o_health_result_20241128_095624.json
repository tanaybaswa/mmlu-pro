Polio is a viral disease that primarily spreads through the fecal-oral route, often due to poor sanitation and hygiene. The most effective method for eradicating polio has been through vaccination, specifically with the polio vaccine, which is not listed as an option here. However, improving sanitation and hygiene can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Herbal remedies - There is no evidence that herbal remedies can eradicate polio.\n\nB. Use of antibiotics - Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses, including the poliovirus.\n\nC. Regular intake of vitamins - Vitamins do not prevent or eradicate viral infections like polio.\n\nD. Administration of tetanus vaccine - The tetanus vaccine is specific to tetanus and does not protect against polio.\n\nE. Attention to sewage control and hygiene - Improving sewage control and hygiene can reduce the spread of polio by minimizing fecal-oral transmission.\n\nF. Natural immunity acquired through exposure - While natural immunity can occur, it is not a reliable or safe method for eradicating polio.\n\nG. Use of antiviral drugs - There are no specific antiviral drugs for eradicating polio.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most relevant option for contributing to the eradication of polio, in the absence of a vaccine option, is improving sewage control and hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}]
