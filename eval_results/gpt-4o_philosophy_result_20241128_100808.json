(c: Chris; d: David; Txy: x teaches y)", "options": ["Tdc", "Tcc", "cTd", "cTc", "dTdc", "dTc", "Tcd", "Tdd", "dTcd", "cTdd"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": "", "category": "philosophy", "src": "ori_mmlu-formal_logic", "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "To translate \"David teaches Chris\" into predicate logic, we need to identify the correct structure using the given predicate \"Txy,\" where \"x teaches y.\" Here, \"d\" represents David, and \"c\" represents Chris. Therefore, the correct translation is \"Tdc,\" meaning \"David (d) teaches (T) Chris (c).\"\n\nThe answer is (A)."}]
