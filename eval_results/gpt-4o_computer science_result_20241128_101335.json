[{"question_id": 10356, "question": "A method is to be written to search an array for a value that is larger than a given item and return its index. The problem specification does not indicate what should be returned if there are several such values in the array.

Option A suggests returning an error if more than one larger value is found. This is not ideal because it doesn't solve the problem; it just indicates an issue.\n\n2. Option B suggests modifying the specification to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values. This is a proactive approach that ensures clarity and completeness in the specification, making it the most logical choice.\n\n3. Option C suggests outputting a message if more than one larger value is found. This is not a standard practice for handling such cases in a method.\n\n4. Option D suggests returning the index of every occurrence of a larger value. This could be a valid approach, but it assumes a specific behavior that is not specified.\n\n5. Option E suggests returning the last occurrence of a larger value. This is another assumption that might not align with the intended behavior.\n\n6. Option F suggests returning a random index of a larger value. This introduces non-deterministic behavior, which is generally undesirable.\n\n7. Option G suggests returning the largest index among larger values. This is another assumption that might not align with the intended behavior.\n\n8. Option H suggests assuming there is only one value in the array that is larger than the given item. This is a risky assumption that could lead to incorrect results.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action is to modify the specification to clearly indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values. This ensures that the method's behavior is well-defined and aligns with the intended use case.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
