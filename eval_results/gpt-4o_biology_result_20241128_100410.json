Mitotic cell division is most prevalent in regions of growth, such as meristems, where cells are actively dividing to contribute to the growth of the plant.\n\n- A. Cross section of muscle tissue: Muscle tissue is not typically associated with active mitotic division, especially in plants, as it is more relevant to animals.\n\n- B. Longitudinal section of a shoot tip: The shoot tip contains the apical meristem, a region where active cell division occurs to facilitate plant growth. This is a likely site for observing mitotic cell divisions.\n\n- C. Longitudinal section of a leaf vein: Leaf veins are primarily involved in transport and are not major sites of cell division.\n\n- D. Cross section of a fruit: Fruits are generally composed of differentiated cells and are not sites of active mitotic division.\n\n- E. Cross section of a leaf: Leaves are primarily composed of differentiated cells and are not major sites of active cell division.\n\n- F. Longitudinal section of a petal: Petals are composed of differentiated cells and are not sites of active mitotic division.\n\n- G. Longitudinal section of a seed: Seeds contain embryonic tissue, but once mature, they are not actively dividing until germination.\n\n- H. Cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower): Anthers contain cells that undergo meiosis to produce pollen, not mitosis.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely option to provide examples of mitotic cell divisions is the longitudinal section of a shoot tip, as it contains the apical meristem where active cell division occurs.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
