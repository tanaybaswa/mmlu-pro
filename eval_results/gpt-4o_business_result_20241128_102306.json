These guidelines are generally focused on ensuring that advertisements are ethical and do not cause harm or offense. Let's analyze each part of the sentence:\n\n1. \"Adverts must not encourage _________\": Regulatory bodies would likely discourage advertisements from promoting \"unsafe practices\" as this could lead to harm or danger to the public.\n\n2. \"Cause unnecessary ________ or _____\": Advertisements should not cause unnecessary \"distress\" or \"fear\" as these emotions can negatively impact the audience and are generally considered unethical in advertising.\n\n3. \"Must not cause _______ offence\": Advertisements should not cause \"serious\" offense, as this would be against the principles of respectful and ethical advertising.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence should read: \"Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example, that adverts must not: encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary distress or fear, and must not cause serious offence.\"\n\nThe answer is (I)."}]
