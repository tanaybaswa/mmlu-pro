Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells and is crucial for growth and repair.\n\n- A. Cross section of muscle tissue: Muscle tissue in animals is not typically a site of active mitotic division, as muscle cells are generally differentiated and do not divide frequently.\n\n- B. Longitudinal section of a shoot tip: The shoot tip, or apical meristem, is a region in plants where active cell division occurs to promote growth. This is a primary site for mitosis in plants.\n\n- C. Longitudinal section of a leaf vein: Leaf veins are primarily involved in transport and are composed of differentiated cells, so they are not major sites of mitotic activity.\n\n- D. Cross section of a fruit: Fruits are typically composed of differentiated cells and are not sites of active mitotic division.\n\n- E. Cross section of a leaf: Leaves are composed of differentiated cells and are not major sites of mitotic activity, although some mitosis can occur in young leaves.\n\n- F. Longitudinal section of a petal: Petals are composed of differentiated cells and are not sites of active mitotic division.\n\n- G. Longitudinal section of a seed: Seeds contain embryonic tissue, which can undergo mitosis during germination, but the seed itself is not actively dividing.\n\n- H. Cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower): Anthers contain cells that undergo meiosis to produce pollen, not mitosis.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that most likely provides examples of mitotic cell divisions is the longitudinal section of a shoot tip, as it is a region of active growth and cell division in plants.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
