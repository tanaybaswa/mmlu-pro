It can help consolidate internal power and create a sense of unity and identity among the people.\n- Option D: Identifying and cultivating talented leaders is a potential reason, but it is more of a byproduct of warfare rather than a primary motivation.\n- Option E: Gaining control of vital resources is a direct and obvious reason for warfare, as it directly benefits the empire's economy and sustainability.\n\nConsidering these options, uniting the population through a common enemy (Option C) stands out as a less obvious reason compared to the others, which are more direct and tangible motivations for warfare.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
