High melting point: This suggests strong bonds between atoms or molecules. Ionic, covalent network, and metallic bonds typically have high melting points.\n\n2. Poor conductor of electricity: This rules out metallic bonding, as metals are generally good conductors of electricity.\n\n3. Does not dissolve in water: This suggests that the substance is not ionic, as many ionic compounds dissolve in water.\n\nGiven these properties, the most likely type of bonding is covalent network bonding. Substances with covalent network bonding, such as diamond or quartz, have high melting points, are poor conductors of electricity, and do not dissolve in water.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
