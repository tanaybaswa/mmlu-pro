To demonstrate their military prowess to potential allies and enemies (A): This could be a reason, but it is more of a strategic or diplomatic reason rather than a less obvious one.\n\n2. To expand their empire's territory (B): This is a very obvious reason for any empire to engage in wars, so it doesn't fit the criteria of being \"less obvious.\"\n\n3. To unite their own population through a common enemy (C): This is a plausible reason. Engaging in wars can create a sense of unity and purpose among the population, rallying them against a common external threat. This is a less obvious reason compared to territorial expansion or resource acquisition.\n\n4. To identify and cultivate talented leaders (D): This is another plausible reason. Wars can serve as a testing ground for leadership skills, allowing the Inca to identify and promote capable leaders within their ranks. This is a less obvious reason compared to the more direct benefits of war.\n\n5. To gain control of vital resources (E): Like territorial expansion, this is a more obvious reason for engaging in wars.\n\nConsidering these options, the less obvious reasons are likely to be either uniting the population through a common enemy or identifying and cultivating talented leaders. However, the idea of uniting the population through a common enemy (C) is a strategic social reason that is not immediately apparent when considering the typical motivations for war.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
