Background: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the U.S. Congress on August 7, 1964, following two alleged incidents involving U.S. naval vessels and North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\n2. Purpose: The resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to use military force in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war. It essentially allowed the president to take \"all necessary measures\" to repel any armed attack against U.S. forces and prevent further aggression.\n\n3. Impact: The resolution significantly escalated U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. It provided the legal justification for the deployment of conventional U.S. forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\n4. Conclusion: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution did not reduce U.S. troop levels, enhance Congressional control, or lead to diplomatic negotiations. Instead, it marked a significant escalation of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution allowed the U.S. to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
