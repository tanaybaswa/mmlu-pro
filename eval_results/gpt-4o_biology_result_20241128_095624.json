[{"question_id": 2804, "question": "Which of the following would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions?", "options": ["cross section of muscle tissue", "longitudinal section of a shoot tip", "longitudinal section of a leaf vein", "cross section of a fruit", "cross section of a leaf", "longitudinal section of a petal", "longitudinal section of a seed", "cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower)"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "cot_content": "", "category": "biology", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_biology", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "To determine which option would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions, we need to consider where active cell division typically occurs.\n\n- A. Cross section of muscle tissue: Muscle tissue in animals is generally composed of differentiated cells that do not frequently undergo mitosis.\n  \n- B. Longitudinal section of a shoot tip: The shoot tip of a plant is part of the apical meristem, which is a region of active cell division and growth. This is a likely site for observing mitotic cell divisions.\n  \n- C. Longitudinal section of a leaf vein: Leaf veins are primarily involved in transport and are composed of differentiated cells, so they are not typically sites of active mitosis.\n  \n- D. Cross section of a fruit: Fruits are generally composed of mature, differentiated cells, and are not sites of active mitosis.\n  \n- E. Cross section of a leaf: Leaves are composed of differentiated cells that do not frequently undergo mitosis.\n  \n- F. Longitudinal section of a petal: Petals are composed of differentiated cells and are not sites of active mitosis.\n  \n- G. Longitudinal section of a seed: Seeds contain embryonic tissue, which can undergo mitosis during germination, but in a mature seed, active mitosis is not typically observed.\n  \n- H. Cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower): Anthers contain pollen mother cells that undergo meiosis to produce pollen, not mitosis.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely option to provide examples of mitotic cell divisions is the shoot tip, where active growth and cell division occur.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
