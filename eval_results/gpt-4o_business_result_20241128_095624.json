These bodies generally focus on ensuring that advertisements do not promote harmful or unethical behavior and do not cause unnecessary harm or offense to the public.\n\n1. Encourage Unsafe Practices: Regulatory bodies typically do not want advertisements to encourage unsafe practices. Therefore, the first blank should be \"Unsafe practices.\"\n\n2. Cause Unnecessary Distress or Fear: Advertisements should not cause unnecessary distress or fear. Therefore, the second blank should be \"Distress,\" and the third blank should be \"Fear.\"\n\n3. Must Not Cause Serious Offense: Advertisements should not cause serious offense to the public. Therefore, the fourth blank should be \"Serious.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence should read: \"Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example, that adverts must not: encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary distress or fear, and must not cause serious offense.\"\n\nThe correct option is: I.
