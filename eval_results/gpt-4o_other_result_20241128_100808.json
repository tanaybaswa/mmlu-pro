Background: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, following two separate incidents involving the USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of North Vietnam.\n\n2. Purpose: The resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to use military force in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war. It essentially allowed the President to take \"all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.\"\n\n3. Impact: The resolution is significant because it marked a major escalation in the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. It provided the legal justification for the deployment of conventional U.S. forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\n4. Conclusion: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution did not reduce U.S. troops, enhance Congressional control, or lead to diplomatic negotiations. Instead, it allowed the U.S. to intensify its military involvement in Vietnam.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
