The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, in response to alleged attacks on U.S. naval vessels by North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\n1. Background: The resolution was a reaction to incidents involving the USS Maddox and the USS Turner Joy, which were reported to have been attacked by North Vietnamese forces. These incidents were used by the U.S. government to justify increased military action in Vietnam.\n\n2. Content of the Resolution: The resolution granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to use military force in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war. It essentially gave the president the power to take \"all necessary measures\" to repel any armed attack against U.S. forces and to prevent further aggression.\n\n3. Impact: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is significant because it marked a major escalation in U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. It allowed for the deployment of more U.S. troops and increased military operations in Vietnam, leading to a significant intensification of the conflict.\n\n4. Conclusion: Given this context, the resolution did not reduce U.S. involvement, enhance Congressional control, or lead to diplomatic negotiations. Instead, it provided the legal basis for the U.S. to escalate its military involvement in Vietnam.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
