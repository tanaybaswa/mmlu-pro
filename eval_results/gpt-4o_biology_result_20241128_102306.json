[{"question_id": 2804, "question": "Which of the following would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions?", "options": ["cross section of muscle tissue", "longitudinal section of a shoot tip", "longitudinal section of a leaf vein", "cross section of a fruit", "cross section of a leaf", "longitudinal section of a petal", "longitudinal section of a seed", "cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower)"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "cot_content": "", "category": "biology", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_biology", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "To determine which option would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions, we need to consider where active cell division typically occurs in plants and animals.\n\n- A. Cross section of muscle tissue: Muscle tissue in animals is generally composed of differentiated cells that do not frequently undergo mitosis. Muscle cells are specialized and typically do not divide.\n\n- B. Longitudinal section of a shoot tip: The shoot tip of a plant is part of the apical meristem, which is a region of active cell division. This is where growth occurs, and cells are frequently undergoing mitosis.\n\n- C. Longitudinal section of a leaf vein: Leaf veins are primarily composed of vascular tissue, which is specialized and not typically a site of active cell division.\n\n- D. Cross section of a fruit: Fruits are composed of mature, differentiated cells that are not actively dividing.\n\n- E. Cross section of a leaf: Leaves are composed of mature, differentiated cells, and while some cell division can occur, it is not a primary site for mitosis.\n\n- F. Longitudinal section of a petal: Petals are composed of differentiated cells that are not actively dividing.\n\n- G. Longitudinal section of a seed: Seeds contain embryonic tissue, which can undergo cell division, but the seed itself is not actively dividing until germination.\n\n- H. Cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower): Anthers contain cells that undergo meiosis to produce pollen, but they are not primarily sites of mitotic cell division.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that most likely provides examples of mitotic cell divisions is the longitudinal section of a shoot tip, as it is part of the apical meristem where active cell division occurs.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
