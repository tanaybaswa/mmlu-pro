This resonance means that for every orbit Ganymede completes, Europa completes two orbits, and Io completes four orbits. This gravitational interaction helps maintain the stability of their orbits and prevents them from colliding with each other. Additionally, this resonance contributes to the tidal heating of Io, making its orbit slightly elliptical. However, the primary significance of the resonance is that it prevents the moons from colliding with each other by maintaining their orbital stability. \n\nThe answer is (E)."}]
