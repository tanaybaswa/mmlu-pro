[{"question_id": 1986, "question": "A person who received a Level 4 rating on the Rancho Los Amigos Scale of Cognitive Functioning:", "options": ["is unresponsive to all stimuli but shows signs of basic physiological functioning such as breathing and heartbeat.", "is highly responsive and coherent, but cannot remember or integrate past and recent events.", "is functioning at an intellectual level that is average for his/her age, education, and demographic background.", "is responsive to stimuli but cannot remember or integrate past and recent events, and exhibits impaired judgment.", "is confused and incoherent, may exhibit bizarre behavior, and is unable to care for him/herself.", "is functioning at an intellectual level that is superior for his/her age, education, and demographic background.", "is nonresponsive to visual or auditory stimuli and seems to be in a state of deep sleep.", "is alert and oriented and can remember and integrate remote and recent events but may have some impairment in judgment, planning, and abstract reasoning."], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "cot_content": "", "category": "psychology", "src": "ori_mmlu-professional_psychology", "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the Rancho Los Amigos Scale of Cognitive Functioning, which is used to assess the cognitive recovery of patients with brain injuries. The scale ranges from Level 1 to Level 10, with each level describing a different stage of recovery.\n\n- Level 1: No Response - The patient does not respond to external stimuli and appears to be in a deep sleep.\n- Level 2: Generalized Response - The patient responds inconsistently and non-purposefully to stimuli.\n- Level 3: Localized Response - The patient responds specifically but inconsistently to stimuli.\n- Level 4: Confused/Agitated - The patient is in a heightened state of activity with severely decreased ability to process information. They may exhibit bizarre, non-purposeful, or incoherent behavior and are unable to care for themselves.\n\nGiven this information, a person who received a Level 4 rating on the Rancho Los Amigos Scale would be confused and agitated, exhibiting bizarre behavior and being unable to care for themselves. This matches option E.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}]
