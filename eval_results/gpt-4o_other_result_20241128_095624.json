The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, in response to two alleged incidents involving North Vietnamese forces attacking U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\n1. Background: The resolution was a response to the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, where it was reported that North Vietnamese forces attacked U.S. ships. This incident was used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to seek congressional approval for increased military action in Vietnam.\n\n2. Content of the Resolution: The resolution gave President Johnson the authority to use military force in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war. It essentially allowed the president to take \"all necessary measures\" to repel any armed attack against U.S. forces and prevent further aggression.\n\n3. Impact: The resolution significantly escalated U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. It provided the legal justification for the deployment of conventional U.S. forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\n4. Conclusion: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is significant because it allowed the U.S. to intensify its involvement in Vietnam, leading to a large-scale military commitment and escalation of the conflict.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
