[{"question_id": 10356, "question": "A method is to be written to search an array for a value that is larger than a given item and return its index. The problem specification does not indicate what should be returned if there are several such values in the array. Which of the following actions would be best?", "options": ["The method should return an error if more than one larger value is found.", "The specification should be modified to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values.", "The method should be written to output a message if more than one larger value is found.", "The method should be written so as to return the index of every occurrence of a larger value.", "The method should be written to return the last occurrence of a larger value.", "The method should return a random index of a larger value.", "The method should be written to return the largest index among larger values.", "The method should be written on the assumption that there is only one value in the array that is larger than the given item."], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "cot_content": "", "category": "computer science", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_computer_science", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "To determine the best action when the problem specification does not indicate what should be returned if there are several values larger than the given item, we need to consider the clarity and completeness of the specification.\n\n1. Option A suggests returning an error if more than one larger value is found. This is not ideal because it doesn't solve the problem; it just indicates an issue.\n\n2. Option B suggests modifying the specification to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values. This is a proactive approach that ensures the specification is clear and complete, which is generally a good practice in software development.\n\n3. Option C suggests outputting a message if more than one larger value is found. This is not a standard practice for handling such cases and could lead to inconsistent behavior.\n\n4. Option D suggests returning the index of every occurrence of a larger value. This could be a valid approach, but it might not align with the intended use of the method unless specified.\n\n5. Option E suggests returning the last occurrence of a larger value. This is a specific choice but might not be what the user expects without clear specification.\n\n6. Option F suggests returning a random index of a larger value. This is not a reliable or predictable approach.\n\n7. Option G suggests returning the largest index among larger values. This is a specific choice but, like option E, might not align with user expectations without specification.\n\n8. Option H suggests assuming there is only one value larger than the given item. This assumption could lead to incorrect results if there are multiple larger values.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action is to ensure the specification is clear and complete. Therefore, modifying the specification to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values is the most appropriate action.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
