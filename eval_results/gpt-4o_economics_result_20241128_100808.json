In the context of GDP, \"C\" stands for \"Consumption,\" which refers to the total value of all goods and services consumed by households. This includes spending on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The purchase of a new car by a car rental company - This would be classified under \"Investment\" (I) because it is a business investment, not household consumption.\n\nB. The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company - This is also an \"Investment\" (I) as it is a capital expenditure by a business.\n\nC. A company buying a new office building - This is an \"Investment\" (I) as it involves business capital expenditure.\n\nD. A homeowner mowing her own lawn - This is not included in GDP as it is a non-market activity.\n\nE. Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts - This is an \"Intermediate good\" and not directly counted in GDP; it is part of the production process.\n\nF. The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm - This is an \"Investment\" (I) as it is a business expense.\n\nG. $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant - This is \"Consumption\" (C) because it is household spending on services.\n\nH. A barber cutting his own hair - This is not included in GDP as it is a non-market activity.\n\nThe option that fits under \"C\" for consumption is G, as it represents household spending on services.\n\nThe answer is (G)."}]
