High melting point: This suggests strong bonds between atoms or molecules. Both ionic and covalent network bonds can result in high melting points.\n\n2. Poor conductor of electricity: This property is typical of covalent network solids, as they do not have free-moving charged particles. Ionic compounds, when solid, are also poor conductors, but they conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water.\n\n3. Does not dissolve in water: Covalent network solids are generally insoluble in water. Ionic compounds, on the other hand, often dissolve in water.\n\nGiven these properties, the substance is most likely a covalent network solid. Covalent network bonding involves a continuous network of covalent bonds, which results in high melting points, poor electrical conductivity, and insolubility in water.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}]
