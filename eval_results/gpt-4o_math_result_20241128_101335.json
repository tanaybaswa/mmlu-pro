This is a well-known result in ring theory. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the zero element in the codomain. If the kernel is only the zero element, it means that no two distinct elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain, which is the definition of injectivity. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\n- This statement is not specific enough to determine its truth value. Without additional context or information about what \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) are, we cannot assess whether \\( Q \\) is an ideal in \\( R \\). Therefore, Statement 2 is not given.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is True.\n- Statement 2 is Not Given.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}]
